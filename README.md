# design-patterns
A collection of all twenty-three design patterns, along with explanations in my own words.  When I was learning these, I tried to find very clear and simple resources that walked you through step-by-step, and they aren't as common as you would think.  So that's what I'm going to try to do here.  It will take some time therefore please bear with me and keep checking back.
